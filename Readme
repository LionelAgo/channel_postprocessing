Solver:             DNS were undertaken using PyFR (http://www.pyfr.org/)
	            - based on the high-order flux reconstruction method
                    of Huynh
                    - compressible solver
                    - a Rusanov Riemann solver was employed to calculate the
                    inter-element fluxes
                    - an explicit RK45[2R+] scheme was used to advance the
                    solution in time
